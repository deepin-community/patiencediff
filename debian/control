Description: diff implementation with balanced performance, output and implementation
 This package contains the implementation of the ``patiencediff`` algorithm, as
 first described by Bram Cohen.
 .
 Like Python's ``difflib``, this module provides both a convience
 ``unified_diff`` function for the generation of unified diffs of text files as
 well as a SequenceMatcher that can be used on arbitrary lists.
 .
 Patiencediff provides a good balance of performance, nice output for humans,
 and implementation simplicity.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of the library.
